= Asciidoctor Lazy Images

This is a small extension that adds the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading[lazy loading attribute] to every image in a rendered HTML5 file.

This makes it so that the page loads faster and unnecesary bandwidth isn't consumed.

== Installation
Install the gem using

[source, shell]
gem install asciidoctor-lazy-images

And compile your files using the `-r` flag:

[source, shell]
asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-lazy-images demo.adoc
